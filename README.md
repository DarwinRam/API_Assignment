# Random Picture & Greeting Web App
This web app fetches a random image and a random greeting whenever the "Get Picture & Greeting" button is clicked. The image is sourced from the Picsum Photos API, and the greeting comes from the API-Ninjas Quotes API, using an API key.

# Features:
Random Image: Displays a new random image each time the button is clicked.
Random Greeting: Displays a random greeting fetched from the Quotes API.
Fallback Greetings: In case the API fails or returns no greeting, a list of fallback greetings is shown.

# Technologies:
JavaScript: Used to handle the fetching of data and updating the webpage dynamically.
HTML/CSS: Basic structure and styling for the webpage.

# Steps to Run:
1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open index.html in your browser.
3. Click the "Get Picture & Greeting" button to fetch a random image and greeting.
